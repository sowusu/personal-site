    As a millennial, I thoroughly enjoy how accessible information has become. That said, it is mind-boggling the amount of information out there these days. I find that podcasts can be a great life-hack for pushing the limits of my daily dose of information.

The podcasts I share below really push the envelope by presenting painstakingly researched insights, invaluable life experiences and anecdotes, as well as awe-inspiring feats of creativity, all on a silver platter. From early-morning commutes to late-night gym sessions, these power-packed podcasts keep my mind engaged and stimulated all through the day.

### 1. Freakonomics Radio

Freakonomics radio is one my favorite podcasts of all time. I am drawn to its data-driven, first-principles approach of breaking down everyday socio-economic systems, phenomena, occurrences etc. Its host, Stephen Dubner, infuses in each episode a healthy level of playful humor, and at the same time, breaks down social economics in a very accessible, applicable way. Dubnerâ€™s arguments and vocal cadences tug at my curiosity in a way that is both bewitchingly entrancing and scientifically satiating.
